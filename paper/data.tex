\section{Data}
\label{intro}



We combine university, state, city,  county, and k-12 school teacher's payroll data.  Each institution's payroll data has amount paid to an individual's name i.e. John Smith \$15000.  We run the names through 4 algorithms that impute race using an individual's first and/or last name.  We use \href{https://github.com/appeler/ethnicolr}{Ethnicor}'s algorithms, which uses US census data and Florida voting registration data to determine the race of an individual.  We average the 4 algorithms' predictions for our analysis.
